version 1.9.1:
Updated German translation.  Thanks to Daniel Leidert for this work.
Fixed some keyboard and text input issues.  Mainly, it's possible to label
  carbons again, and type characters that are not US-English letters and
  numbers.  This should also fix some format issues.
You can now change font settings within XDrawChem and have them saved between
  sessions.
Fixed arrow behavior.  All arrow types render correctly, and it's possible
  to change the thickness of some arrow types.
Fixed custom rings dialog.  Custom rings saved to user's home directory
  now appear on menu correctly.  Menu is also dynamically updated, so new
  structures appear immediately without need to restart XDrawChem.

version 1.9:
Added Russian language translation file.  Thanks to Vitaly Lipatov and Roman
  Borisyuk for conributing this work.
Fixed dialogs that display Help.  It's now possible to use the Help dialog, 
  and close it without closing the tool you are using.
Eliminated Elemental analysis dialog.  This feature is now part of Molecule
  Information.
Fixed a bug in the text tool that caused a segfault when clicking off of an
  empty text field.  Also updated text toopl behavior to more accurately show
  what would be selected, moved, etc. on mouse click.
Fixed a bug where aromatic and other rings would have infinite scale and
  random rotation if attached to an existing bond.  Rings now attach
  correctly, even to vertical bonds.
Keyboard input for non-English users is fixed.  You can finally type letters
  with umlauts (e.g., "SÃ¤ure") and other accents.
You can paste text from other applications with Ctrl+V.  However, you must
  select the Text tool first and create a new text box.
The width of any bond (double, triple, dashed, ...) may be changed now.

version 1.8.5:
Fixed EPS output by using "ps2epsi" script supplied with GhostScript to
  process the file.

  warnings.
(contributed) Made some pixmaps transparent to improve print quality.

  have net access, you can access all DB features now.

Zoom/magnify tools now exist.
Double bond alignment fixes.  You can set a specific double bond style
  by right-clicking on the double bond.
