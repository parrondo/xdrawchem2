version 1.99.1:
Updated code to use Qt 4.x, with extensive contributed code.

Fixed bug #1255229, relating to correct rendering of super- and subscripts.
Added a feature to send 3-D structures to external programs ghemical and
  KryoMol.  More programs will be added on request.
Removed canonical SMILES generation.  This feature was dependent on a cgi-bin
  script that will not run on xdrawchem.org's new host.  InChI, the new NIST-
  IUPAC standard, should be used for canonicalization.

version 1.9.8:
Worked on bug #1236716 and #1255229, regarding XDrawChem's rendering 
  of text typed into the QTextEdit mini text editor.

  database, and updated XDrawChem to link to PubChem compound records where
  available.

Fixed sf.net bug #1221480 pertaining to QPainter errors.
Added antibody (Symbol) and biotin (pre-defined functional group).

  functions are used.

Resolved sf.net bug #1200630 relating to loading and saving formatted text.
Resolved sf.net bug #1198595, relating to segfaults in the IR tool.
Updated to use newer Qt classes (e.g., QPtrLst instead of QList).  Many thanks
  to Gerd Fleischer for contributing a very large patch.
Added text shape options.
Fill color can be set for ellipse/rectangle bracket types.
Updated paint/print functions to use a single global painter object.  Print
  and images should look the same as what you drew on screen now!  Image size
  is now passed to ImageMagick (if available) so images should be same size
  as on-screen.

version 1.9.5:
Removed m4 / autom4te stuff from CVS and distributions!
Added arrow, symbol, ring drawing change suggested in tracker #1175966.
Resolved Edit > Cut bug, tracker #1178101.

-- is installed.

  sf.net bug #1169699.

version 1.9.3:
Fixed issue with color selection and color in EPS files.
Aliphatic chains are now consistently drawn correctly.
Undo and load/save correctly handle explicit "C" labels on carbons.

version 1.9.1:
Updated German translation.  Thanks to Daniel Leidert for this work.
Fixed some keyboard and text input issues.  Mainly, it's possible to label
  carbons again, and type characters that are not US-English letters and
  numbers.  This should also fix some format issues.
You can now change font settings within XDrawChem and have them saved between
  sessions.
Fixed arrow behavior.  All arrow types render correctly, and it's possible
  to change the thickness of some arrow types.
Fixed custom rings dialog.  Custom rings saved to user's home directory
  now appear on menu correctly.  Menu is also dynamically updated, so new
  structures appear immediately without need to restart XDrawChem.

version 1.9:
Added Russian language translation file.  Thanks to Vitaly Lipatov and Roman
  Borisyuk for conributing this work.
Fixed dialogs that display Help.  It's now possible to use the Help dialog, 
  and close it without closing the tool you are using.

  Information.
Fixed a bug in the text tool that caused a segfault when clicking off of an
  empty text field.  Also updated text toopl behavior to more accurately show
  what would be selected, moved, etc. on mouse click.
Fixed a bug where aromatic and other rings would have infinite scale and
  random rotation if attached to an existing bond.  Rings now attach
  correctly, even to vertical bonds.
Keyboard input for non-English users is fixed.  You can finally type letters
  with umlauts (e.g., "SÃ¤ure") and other accents.
You can paste text from other applications with Ctrl+V.  However, you must
  select the Text tool first and create a new text box.
The width of any bond (double, triple, dashed, ...) may be changed now.

version 1.8.5:
Fixed EPS output by using "ps2epsi" script supplied with GhostScript to
  process the file.
Updated some deprecated functions to current version and fixed some
  warnings.
(contributed) Made some pixmaps transparent to improve print quality.

Updated Polish translation.
Pressing Escape now puts you back in select mode, regardless of current state.
Moved XDrawChem database, and eliminated dependency of frowns, sort of.

  have net access, you can access all DB features now.

Zoom/magnify tools now exist.
Double bond alignment fixes.  You can set a specific double bond style
  by right-clicking on the double bond.
