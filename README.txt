XDrawChem is a two-dimensional molecule drawing program for Unix
operating systems.  It is similar in functionality to other molecule
drawing programs such as ChemDraw (TM, CambridgeSoft).  It can read
and write MDL Molfiles and CML files to allow sharing between
XDrawChem and other chemistry applications.  XDrawChem has been tested
on Linux, Sun Solaris and SGI IRIX.  XDrawChem was designed with Qt
3.0 or later, available free from http://www.trolltech.com/
XDrawChem also depends on the OpenBabel library, http://openbabel.sf.net/

Please read INSTALL.txt which gives instructions on how to install
XDrawChem.

XDrawChem features an online manual.  Run the program and press F1 (or 
select Manual under the Help menu) for instructions.

The HISTORY file lists changes made in each revision.
